Countdown for a special moment

Look it here: http://grawl.github.com/Countdown/

Tasks:

- **OPTIMIZE THIS SHITCODE JAVASCRIPT** in *custom.js*, it is very slow and has a lot of stupid mechanics, but I'm a n00b in JS :3
- Put it on special domain
- Update to another special date after New Year
- Add some social features *like Facebook, Vkontakte and Twitter buttons*
- Change background to random in each hit
- Add link to GitHub, smaller than a regular ribbon-link.
